                    <p className="text-center mt-3">I recently completed a fulltime web development bootcamp hosted by Awesome Inc in August of 2023. We covered everything from HTML to Django Backend and REST APIs. Since then I have been working on going deeper into the foundation they laid to become a better fullstack developer. I will continue to add my projects to my portfolio here as I continue to grow! Aside from coding, I'm a father to a beautiful little girl, I also love to read, play video games, and binge watch 'The Office' with my wife. Thanks for checking out my portfolio, I hope to connect!</p>
